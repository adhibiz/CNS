## EX. NO: 1(A) : IMPLEMENTATION OF CAESAR CIPHER
 

## AIM:

To implement the simple substitution technique named Caesar cipher using Python.

## DESCRIPTION:

To encrypt a message with a Caesar cipher, each letter in the message is changed using a simple rule: shift by three. Each letter is replaced by the letter three letters ahead in the alphabet. A becomes D, B becomes E, and so on. For the last letters, we can think of the
alphabet as a circle and "wrap around". W becomes Z, X becomes A, Y bec mes B, and Z
becomes C. To change a message back, each letter is replaced by the one three before it.

## EXAMPLE:

## ALGORITHM:

### STEP-1: Read the plain text from the user.
### STEP-2: Read the key value from the user.
### STEP-3: If the key is positive then encrypt the text by adding the key with each character in the plain text.
### STEP-4: Else subtract the key from the plain text.
### STEP-5: Display the cipher text obtained above.


PROGRAM :-
~~~
#A python program to illustrate Caesar Cipher Technique
def encrypt(text,s):
    result = ""

    # traverse text
    for i in range(len(text)):
        char = text[i]

        # Encrypt uppercase characters
        if (char.isupper()):
            result += chr((ord(char) + s-65) % 26 + 65)

        # Encrypt lowercase characters
        else:
            result += chr((ord(char) + s - 97) % 26 + 97)

    return result

#check the above function
text = "ATTACKATO
s = 4
print ("Text  : " + text)
print ("Shift : " + str(s))
print ("Cipher: " + encrypt(text,s))
